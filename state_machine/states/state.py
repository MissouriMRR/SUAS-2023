    This abstract base class serves as the foundation for all state types in the state machine.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _drone : Drone
        The drone to which this state is bound.
    _flight_settings : FlightSettings

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(drone: Drone, flight_settings: FlightSettings) -> None
        Initialize a new state object.

    name() -> str
        Get the name of this state type.

    drone() -> Drone
        Get the drone this state is bound to.

    flight_settings() -> FlightSettings
        Get the flight settings this state is bound to.

    run() -> Awaitable["State"]

    This function takes in a latitude, longitude and altitude and autonomously

    Parameters
    ----------
    drone: System
        a drone object that has all offboard data needed for computation
    latitude: float
        a float containing the requested latitude to move to
    longitude: float
        a float containing the requested longitude to move to
    altitude: float
        a float contatining the requested altitude to go to (in feet)
    fast_param: float
        a float that determines if the drone will take less time checking its precise location
        before moving on to another waypoint. If its 1, it will move at normal speed,
        if its less than 1(0.83), it will be faster.

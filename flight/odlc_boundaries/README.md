**ODLC Boundary Subdirectory**

Execute - Executes the search path code

Search Path - Creates a flight path for the drone to follow within a given set of coordinate points. Line parameters can be adjusted to increase or decrease space between lines if needed (Typically changed when camera settings like focal length are changed)

This code is called when the ODLC state is engaged in the flight state machine.
